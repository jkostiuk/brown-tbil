  "body": " Syllabus   Welcome  Welcome to Math 0520! This page is our official syllabus; it's main purpose is to orient you to our course structure, learning outcomes, and resources that you will access throughout the semester. Please familiarize yourself with the information on this page and refer back to it as needed.   Linear Algebra  Linear algebra is a branch of mathematics devoted to theory of linear equations and transformations. A solid understanding of linear algebra allows you to (among other things):   solve systems of linear equations;    determine the geometry of the set of solutions to such a system;    analyze the geometry and identify important properties of a linear transformation;    use linear algebra to model problems in a variety of disciplines.   These skills will no doubt be used in your future mathematics and STEM courses and we'll feature a few such applications throughout the term.  Math 0520 is a first course in linear algebra that will focus on the development of the standard algorithms in the subject via student inquiry, as well as the underlying geometry. Along the way, you will also develop your ability to understand proofs the logical arguments that form the foundation of mathematical reasoning and get the opportunity to write many of your own.    By the end of this course, you will be able to:     hold a conversation with an expert about linear algebra concepts using correct terminology;    use the critical and abstract thinking skills developed in this course as a foundation for future courses in geometry and algebra;    work productively with a team to analyze different approaches to solving the same problem;    use introspective methods to help you monitor the development of your mathematical maturity;    produce accurate, well-written arguments that communicate solutions to problems that are audience-appropriate;    use your knowledge of algorithms in linear algebra to solve systems of linear equations and to calculate optimal coordinate systems for linear transformations;    explain phenomena surrounding the nature of systems of linear equations, and properties of transformations, in both geometric and algebraic terms;    apply your linear algebra skills to solve problems from a variety of other disciplines.     In addition to the high-level learning outcomes for the course described above, each section of our Activity Book corresponds to a single targeted learning outcome a specific learning outcome that will be assessed throughout our Fluency Assessment protocol that is described below. These targeted learning outcomes are chosen to form a strong foundation for your continued exploration of the course material, with all further knowledge being built up, in some way, from these outcomes.  Here are some of the topics that we will cover in Math 0520:   vectors and vector operations;    systems of linear equations;    matrix operations;    linear transformations;    vector spaces;    determinants;    dot-products and orthogonality;    eigenvalues and eigenvectors   Additional topics will be covered depending on time and class interests.    Am I Ready for Math 0520?  Almost certainly! There are no prerequisities for Math 0520. Most students have usually taken one semester of college-level math (typically calculus), but this is not at all necessary and the contents will not draw upon previous knowledge. This is a great option for a first-year college-level mathematics course.  If it has been a while since you've taken a college-level math course, you may find yourself needing more time to adjust than your classmates. That is normal and we can talk about strategies to accelerate your adaption if this is a concern of yours.  In addition to Math 0520, Brown also offers Math 0540: Linear Algebra with Theory. Math 0540 is a higher-level introduction to linear algebra with a greater emphasis on the development of axiomatic principles and proof-writing skills.    Inclusive Teaching  Large, introductory STEM courses are well-documented as playing an outsized role in dissuading members of historically excluded groups from pursuing STEM careers. I recognize that, as an instructor of this large, introductory mathematics course, the course design decisions that I have made will affect your perceived ability and desire to concentrate in a STEM field. My sincere hope is that you leave Math 0520 a more capable and resilient problem solver and that you feel supported in this journey.  I acknowledge that not every student will have this idealized experience.  I am committed to continuing my education about evidenced-based and equity-focussed approaches to teaching, and to learning from the hundreds of students I have the pleasure of teaching each semester. If you have thoughts, questions, or concerns about this course, or STEM education at Brown, I welcome your perspective and encourage you to reach out to me.    Accessibility Roadmap  It's important to me that you feel you have all the tools you need to succeed in this course. Here are some high-level accessibility features that may help you:    Lesson Recordings    Jordan's lessons are recorded on Zoom and uploaded to the Media Library on Canvas. These may be helpful to you if you miss class, or otherwise want to consult or remind yourself of the flow of a particular lesson.      Activity Book and Videos    This open-access Activity Book is e-reader compatible; we also have the ability to print a braille version! The Activity Book contains short videos at the bottom of each section that may assist you in reviewing after lessons.      If you have SAS accommodations, I will receive your letter through the online portal and send you an email with a detailed plan of your accommodations will be be implemented. Whether or not you have SAS accommodations, you are invited to speak with me about how we can work to better include you in our course.       Course Design   Team Based Inquiry Learning  Team-Based Inquiry Learning (TBIL) is a cooperative learning strategy that blends elements of flipped learning, inquiry-based learning, and problem-based learning. It is a blend of team-based learning and inquiry learning first developed by Lewis, Clontz, and Estis . At its core, students prepare individually for scaffolded team-based problem-solving sessions that are designed to develop the course content and to foster the creativity and curiosity that necessitates strong problem-solving skills.  In short, you'll be spending most of your class time this year working to solve problems in teams of 6, with Instructors and Teaching Fellows guiding you along the way.  The research underlying TBIL indicates that this format leads to greater content mastery and flexibility in problem solving, among other important findings. For more information about this research, please visit the website for Transforming Lower Division Undergraduate Mathematics Through Team-Based Inquiry Learning , an NSF-funded collaboration to study the effects of TBIL in introductory mathematics courses across the United States.    Team Structure & Accountability  You team will consist of 6 people and will be formed by the teaching team. Working with teams allows you to learn from the perspectives and ideas of your teammates, and provides you a sounding board and feedback system to work through your own ideas. The problems that are discussed in class are solely for the purpose of us developing our linear algebra skills collaboratively and do not have any grading structure attached.  We will place you in stable, term-long teams so that you have the time to grow with each other over the term. Here is what to expect for team formation:  Weeks 1 and 2: teams shuffled each class to accommodate shopping period---get to know as many of your classmates as possible!  End of Week 2: a survey will be distributed to collect information from you needed to form teams;  Week 3: first team assignments made by teaching team;  Week 7: Formative Peer Feedback on Team Performance;  Week 13: Summative Peer Feedback on Team Performance.  Our main goal in creating teams is to ensure that each team represents a diversity of mathematical experiences, while ensuring that individuals do not feel isolated. We want you to meet new people and learn from each other's perspectives and experiences. Early in the term, we will send out a survey that will help us form teams.  Your team is primarily responsible for working together on the activities in class and reporting out your responses to the facilitators and other teams. Other team responsibilities that you should consider as a team are:  (how) will we share notes\/our work from the white board?  (how) will we meet outside of class to study or collaborate on problem sets?;  what is our plan to catch up a teammate if they're ill or otherwise unable to participate in a session?  how else can our team support each other this term?  Note that the team structure in this course only pertains to our in-person class time. While we encourage you to collaborate with your teammates over the semester, there is no academic expectation that you work together outside of class, nor are are there any team projects.  In order to help you identify areas of growth and assess the quality of teamwork over the semester, teams will undergo two rounds of anonymous feedback. More details about this process and its logistics are located in Canvas.    Office Hours  Office Hours are one of the most useful resources we have available to you to support your learning. Every member of the teaching team offers Office Hours and you will find their times, locations, and mode (online\/hybrid\/in-person) on Canvas, using a shared Google Calendar. You are welcome (and encouraged) to attend any and all office hours that fit with your schedule it does not have to be your Instructor or Teaching Fellow's. Here are some reasons you might consider attending Office Hours:   Get to know your Instructor of Teaching Fellow! We're ordinary people and like to know our students.    Get more focussed assistance with concepts from class.    Meet other students working on homework.    Practice having conversations about Mathematics.   You will find the complete Calendar on our Canvas homepage.

Outside of these sessions, you will be studying, working on problem sets, reflecting on your progress, and preparing your major assessments. We expect a typical students in this course to spend the following time allocations throughout the term:   3 hours\/week preparing for an attending class    6 hours\/week working on problem sets    1hour\/week working on self-assessments    2 hours\/week reviewing and\/or attending office hours   for a total for 180 hours throughout the semester.     Assessment  This section describes the key assessments for this course and how the fit into your overall grade. More detailed instructions and evaluation criteria are located on Canvas.   Readiness Assurance Tests  To prepare for each of our course modules, you will work through a Readiness Assurance Process (RAP). The RAP consists of three separate phases. First, you will be provided learning outcomes and review materials to refresh yourself on knowledge that you will need for the upcoming module. These materials are found directly in our Activity Book (on the title page of each section) but will also be linked to in Canvas.  After reviewing material, you will then complete the Readiness Assurance Test (RAT). This test has two phases: first you complete the quiz individually (this is known as the individual-RAT or i-RAT) on your own. Then, you will complete the test a second time with your teammates in class (this is known as the team-RAT or t-RAT). You will find these quizzes on Canvas and we will only remember the greater of your two scores on the test. The RATs contribute 7.5% towards your overall grade.    Fluency Assessments  Each section of our Activity Book corresponds to a single targeted learning outcome, each of which is assessed via a Fluency Assessment . On a fluency assessment, you will be asked to complete a number of tasks to demonstrate fluency on the corresponding outcome. If you complete all of these tasks correctly, and provide adequate explanations using our principles of mathematical writing, you will receive a score of Fluent .  If you fall short, you will receive a score of Not Yet Fluent . In this case, you will recieve a second opportunity to earn a score of Fluent by completing a new version of the Fluency Assessment. If you still fall short on the second attempt, you will have yet another third (and final) opportunity a few weeks later. Note that the last handful of objectives in the semester will only have two opportunities total due to logistical constraints.  At the end of the term, your Fluency Assessment score, which is worth 25% of your overall course grade, will be equal to the number of objectives you earned Fluent in out of the total number of objectives we assessed.  The main purpose of the Fluency Assessments is to ensure that you are able to accurately complete the tasks that are aligned with our targeted learning outcomes. In turn, this ensures that you are adequately prepared for further explorations both inside and outside of this course. Since it is important for us to ensure you are doing these tasks accurately, we have a high bar to earn fluency. However, we do not care if you earn fluency on your first attempt, or on a subsequent attempt; all that matters is that, by some combination of practice, review, and the incorporation of feedback, you can eventually demonstrate you are fluent in the objective.  Fluency Assessments are to be completed individually, without the use of your notes or external resources. Representative Fluency Assessments and sample solutions are contained at the bottom of each section of our Activity Book, and an exercise bank of Fluency Assessments is available to you on CheckIt, which is linked throughout the Activity Book and also on Canvas.    Problem Sets  In this course, Problem Sets make up the most significant portion of assessment. Their main purpose is to assess your ability to make sense of new problems, apply concepts in new settings, and further develop your ability to communicate mathematical ideas to an audience of your peers and professionals alike. Problem Sets are significant assignments that we expect students to devote substantial time throughout the available two week period to complete them; they are not designed to be successfully completed within a single sitting.  There are five (5) Problem Sets total throughout the semester and they combine to account for 25% of your overall grade. After receiving your Problem Set back from the teach team, you will have an opportunity to reflect on feedback to earn an additional 4% of credit. Note that this course does not drop any Problem Sets .  To support your success in Problem Sets, we have created a Problem Set Success Guide in . It contains more detailed instructions, expands on our evaluation criteria, and shares resources and strategies to help you succeed on these assessments.  Collaborating on solving the problems on a problem set with other classmates is permitted, though our expectation is that all written work is produced by you and represents your authentic thinking. Written work that closely resembles that of another classmate may be investigated for plagiarism, as is described below on this syllabus.    Capstone Problem Set  The Final Assessment for this course is a Capstone Problem Set. The Capstone Problem Set is structured identically to a standard Problem Set, but is comprehensive in nature. Students will have about one week to complete this assessment throughout the Final Exam Period. The Capstone Problem Set is worth 20% of your overall grade. More detailed instructions will be provided on Canvas closer to the end of the semester.    Reflections  Critical reflection is an integral part of the deep learning process. It helps us digest and personalize what we learn which, in turn, makes our learnings more valuable. Roughly every other week, you'll be asked to share your perspective on a variety of applications and topics in this course, as well as your thought processes. In doing so, we hope you'll be better able to contextualize your learning and identify your growth as a problem solver and mathematician over the course of the term. In other words, these reflections will help you consolidate your learning gains over the term. Reflections are worth 7.5% of your overall grade.    Team Work and Attendance  To assess teamwork, your team will provide both formative and summative feedback to each other throughout the term. Near the half-way mark of the semester, an anonymous form will be shared for your team to provide formative feedback to each other. The main purpose of this feedback is to help you and your team identify way to improve your processes and further cultivate a strong working group. The results of this survey do not affect one's grade, but completion of the survey is worth 2.5% of your overall grade. At the end of the semester, teammates will score their teamwork using criteria co-created by our class; this will make up 5% of your overall grade.  Attendance will be recorded after the end of shopping period. It accounts for 7.5% of a student's overall grade.    Your Final Grade  Your final grade is calculated as a weighted average of the assessments described above. summarizes this calculation.   Overall Course Grade    Assessment  Contribution    Readiness Assurance  7.5%    Attendance  7.5%    Teamwork  7.5%    Reflections  7.5%    Fluency Assessments  25%    Problem Sets  25%    Capstone Problem Set  20%    Total  100%     In turn, your overall course grade will be translated into a letter grade using the cutoffs in   Letter Grades    Overall Grade  Letter Grade    90 100%  A    80 89.9%  B    65 79.9%  C    0 64.9%  NC     Students taking this course S\/NC will receive a grade of S provided that their overall grade is above 65%.     Course Policies   Attendance  Attendance in class sessions is recorded and contributes 7.5% towards your final grade; it is recorded by the teaching team in Canvas beginning after shopping period. Each student is provided one week's worth of personal days (3 sessions for MWF students; 2 sessions to TTh students) to use for absences of any kind. Absences other than these personal days will not be excused, unless accompanied by a Dean's Note. If you are ill or otherwise unable to attend class for a long period of time, please contact your instructor to come up with a plan to keep you on pace for the term. Late attendances (defined as entering class sometime after the first activity of class has begun) are worth 50% of attendances.  Our classroom is equipped with Zoom and I (Jordan) will record all of my class meetings. The recordings will appear in the Media Library on Canvas shortly after class.    Late Work  Deadlines help me keep my workload balanced and keep you on track, ultimately resulting in a better learning experience for all of us. Every assessment in this course has a deadline; some of them are hard deadlines, but there are others for which there is flexibility. Here are the descriptions of the deadlines of our most common assessments:     Readiness Assurance Tests   First attempt due prior to first class of new module (will be indicated on Canvas)    Hard deadline for first attempt.       Fluency Assessments   Hard deadline of Sunday 11:59pm Eastern every week.    If you miss an attempt, you have two others remaining.       Problem Sets   Due 11:59pm Eastern Tuesdays, as\/when indicated on Canvas (there are 5 total)    24-hour no-questions-asked grace period.    No extensions beyond the grace period, unless communicated prior to the due date and accompanied by a Dean's Note.       Reflections   Due Sundays 11:59pm Eastern as indicated on Canvas (there are 5 total)    May turn in within one week after deadline, after which submission closes.          Communication  This course has two primary channels for communicating outside of class and office hours: Ed STEM and e-mail . If you have a question about an assignment, course, policy, concept, or anything else that might benefit the class as a whole, please post on Ed STEM; you're welcome to post anonymously if you are shy. On the other hand, if you need to talk to us about something that is personal to your situation, please do send us an e-mail.  Everyone has different workflows and boundaries around email communication. Here are my expectations when it comes to email communication in this course; your instructor's expectations may differ from these, so take note when they share their own expectations.   I will work to respond to your message within 24 hours, or else on Monday if you write to me on Friday.    I will generally not respond or check email outside of 7:00am-4:30pm Eastern.    You are welcome to refer to me as Jordan via email. If you prefer to use a salutation, then please use one of the following (and no others):   Prof.(essor) Jordan    Prof.(essor) Kostiuk    Dr. Kostiuk           Academic Integrity  High expectations are important because they set the bar for where we want to be. I set high expectations for you, and all of my students, because I know that you can reach them. You set high expectations of me because you know you deserve a quality education. Academic integrity is the intersection of these expectations. In exchange for teaching you to the best ability I can, and continuing to refine my teaching practice, I expect that the work you turn in each and every day is an accurate and faithful snapshot of what you are capable of. Hold yourself and your peers to a high standard of integrity and strive to get the most out of your education.  Please familiarize yourself with Brown's Academic Integrity Policies .   Plagiarism  In this course, plagiarism is defined as submitted work that appears identical in wording, structure, or substance to that of another person's work, whether it appears online or in writing. Some specific examples of plagiarism include:   Fluency Assessments that appear identical to sample solutions.    Problem Set solutions that appear near-identical to those submitted by another student.    Problem Set solutions that appear near-identical to solutions provided in this course or a previous iteration.     If work you submit on a Fluency Assessment is deemed plagiarism by an Instructor, you will receive a score of Not Yet Fluent , and a warning, provided it is the first occurrence. Upon a second occurrence, the case will be forwarded to the Academic Code Committee.  If work you submit on a Problem Set is deemed plagiarism by an Instructor, you will receive a score of 0 for each plagiarized problem, and a warning, provided it is the first occurrence. Upon a second occurrence, the case will be forwarded to the Academic Code Committee.    Best Practices for Collaborating and Using Sample Solutions  We want you to collaborate with your teammates and classmates, and use all the resources that are available to you to support your learning. We also want you to submit authentic work. Here are some tips to help you maximize the resources available and avoid submitting work that may be deemed plagiarism:   When reviewing sample solutions to the CheckIt problems, reflect critically on what each sentence is contributing to the solution. We do not expect (or want) you to turn in solutions that are identical to the ones provided; we want you to communicate the required ideas and structures in your own words, using the new terminology you are learning.    When collaborating on a Problem Set, avoid looking at the written work of a collaborate. Instead, use a white board or scrap paper and attempt to communicate ideas verbally, and internalizing them.       "

  "title": "For Instructors",
  "body": " For Instructors   Features of the text  The book is organized into Modules. You can think of a module as a chapter in a textbook.  In a TBIL course, each module starts with a Readiness Assurance Process to check understanding of and and solidify prerequisite knowledge (from other courses or previous modules) that will be needed in the upcoming module. The front page for each module provides a list of these Readiness Assurance outcomes, along with study resources and exercise students can use to refresh themselve on this prerequisite knowledge. Readiness Assurance Tests that assess this knowledge are available as part of the TBIL Resource Libary (see ). Join the TBIL community (see ) to gain access to these.  Within each module there is a varying amount of sections, one per learning outcome. Each section is designed to guide students into being able to demonstrate their understanding of that specific outcome. The learning outcome can be tested with a CheckIt Exercise, which are linked at the end of each section.  Within each section, students engage in Activities, which are interpersed with definitions, theorems, remarks, examples, etc. as needed to guide the learning process. The activities start in an exploratory way then building the concepts on the results of this exploration. The concepts are then practiced with less scaffolding to build fluency. Finally, towards the end of the section we connect the concepts and extend them to new settings.

Each of the following linear systems has the same solution set.   A)   B)   C)     D)   E)   F)    Sort these six equivalent linear systems from most complicated to simplest (in your opinion).      Here we've written the sorted linear systems from as augmented matrices.   Assign the following row operations to each step used to manipulate each matrix to the next:               A matrix is in reduced row echelon form ( RREF ) Reduced row echelon form if   The leftmost nonzero term of each row is 1. We call these terms pivots . pivot   Each pivot is to the right of every higher pivot.  Each term that is either above or below a pivot is 0.  All zero rows (rows whose terms are all 0) are at the bottom of the matrix.   Every matrix has a unique reduced row echelon form. If is a matrix, we write for the reduced row echelon form of that matrix.      Recall that a matrix is in reduced row echelon form ( RREF ) if   The leftmost nonzero term of each row is 1. We call these terms pivots .  Each pivot is to the right of every higher pivot.  Each term that is either above or below a pivot is 0.  All zero rows (rows whose terms are all 0) are at the bottom of the matrix.   For each matrix, mark the leading terms, and label it as RREF or not RREF. For the ones not in RREF, determine which rule is violated and how it might be fixed.           Recall that a matrix is in reduced row echelon form ( RREF ) if   The leftmost nonzero term of each row is 1. We call these terms pivots .  Each pivot is to the right of every higher pivot.  Each term that is either above or below a pivot is 0.  All zero rows (rows whose terms are all 0) are at the bottom of the matrix.   For each matrix, mark the leading terms, and label it as RREF or not RREF. For the ones not in RREF, determine which rule is violated and how it might be fixed.           In practice, if we simply need to convert a matrix into reduced row echelon form, we use technology to do so.  However, it is also important to understand the Gauss-Jordan elimination Gauss-Jordan elimination algorithm that a computer or calculator uses to convert a matrix (augmented or not) into reduced row echelon form. Understanding this algorithm will help us better understand how to interpret the results in many applications we use it for in .      Consider the matrix Which row operation is the best choice for the first move in converting to RREF?   Add row 3 to row 2 ( )  Add row 2 to row 3 ( )  Swap row 1 to row 2 ( )  Add -2 row 2 to row 1 ( )       Consider the matrix Which row operation is the best choice for the next move in converting to RREF?

Add row 1 to row 2 ( )  Add -1 row 3 to row 2 ( )  Add -1 row 2 to row 3 ( )  Add row 2 to row 1 ( )      The steps for the Gauss-Jordan elimination algorithm may be summarized as follows:   Ignoring any rows that already have marked pivots, identify the leftmost column with a nonzero entry.    Use row operations to obtain a pivot of value in the topmost row that does not already have a marked pivot.    Mark this pivot, then use row operations to change all values above and below the marked pivot to .    Repeat these steps until the matrix is in RREF.     In particular, once a pivot is marked, it should remain in the same position . This will keep you from undoing your progress towards an RREF matrix.     Complete the following RREF calculation (multiple row operations may be needed for certain steps):        Consider the matrix   Compute .

Transformation of the unit square by the matrix    What are the lengths of and ?  What is the area of the transformed unit square?     It is possible to find two nonparallel vectors that are scaled but not rotated by the linear map given by .        Certain vectors are stretched out without being rotated.   The process for finding such vectors will be covered later in this chapter.      Notice that while a linear map can transform vectors in various ways, linear maps always transform parallelograms into parallelograms, and these areas are always transformed by the same factor: in the case of , this factor is .      A linear map transforming parallelograms into parallelograms.   Since this change in area is always the same for a given linear map, it will be equal to the value of the transformed unit square (which begins with area ).      We will define the determinant of a square matrix , or for short, to be the factor by which scales areas. In order to figure out how to compute it, we first figure out the properties it must satisfy.      The linear transformation scaling areas by a constant factor, which we call the determinant       The transformation of the unit square by the standard matrix is illustrated below. If is the area of resulting parallelogram, what is the value of ?      The transformation of the unit square by the identity matrix.

B. : the value of directly scales the determinant area because it scales the base of the parallelogram.       Describe the value of .                 Cannot be determined from this information.        The determinant is the unique function satisfying these properties:   whenever two columns of the matrix are identical.   , assuming no other columns change.   , assuming no other columns change.    Note that these last two properties together can be phrased as The determinant is linear in each column.       The determinant must also satisfy other properties. Consider and .   The base of both parallelograms is , while the height has not changed, so the determinant does not change either. This can also be proven using the other properties of the determinant:       Swapping columns may be thought of as a reflection, which is represented by a negative determinant. For example, the following matrices transform the unit square into the same parallelogram, but the second matrix reflects its orientation.       Reflection of a parallelogram as a result of swapping columns.       The fact that swapping columns multiplies determinants by a negative may be verified by adding and subtracting columns.       To summarize, we've shown that the column versions of the three row-reducing operations a matrix may be used to simplify a determinant in the following way:   Multiplying a column by a scalar multiplies the determinant by that scalar:   Swapping two columns changes the sign of the determinant:   Adding a multiple of a column to another column does not change the determinant:        The transformation given by the standard matrix scales areas by , and the transformation given by the standard matrix scales areas by . By what factor does the transformation given by the standard matrix scale areas?      Area changing under the composition of two linear maps             Cannot be determined       Since the transformation given by the standard matrix is obtained by applying the transformations given by and , it follows that .      Recall that row operations may be produced by matrix multiplication.   Multiply the first row of by :   Swap the first and second row of :   Add times the third row to the first row of :        The determinants of row operation matrices may be computed by manipulating columns to reduce each matrix to the identity:   Scaling a row:   Swapping rows:   Adding a row multiple to another row:        Consider the row operation applied as follows to show :    Find a matrix such that , by applying the same row operation to .

  "title": "Problem Set Success Guide",
  "body": " Problem Set Success Guide   What are Problem Sets?  The term Problem Set is used commonly in STEM courses at Brown and, generally, means some form of written assignment in which students solve problems. While this term may be familiar, the experience of working on a problem set varies greatly between courses because different courses may have different expectations for quality and style of writing, and there may be different expectations surrounding the types of problems that students are expected to solve.  The purpose of this brief guide is to clarify expectations around Problem Sets in this course. Your Problem Sets make up a significant portion of your grade and, as such, are expected to take a significant amount of time and effort to do well on them.    What Kinds of Problems Will Appear on Problem Sets?  Different types of problems assess different learning outcomes and promote the development of different skills and habits. To help you better understand the kind of problems that you will encounter your problem set (and why you are encountering them), it is instructive to examine the basic types of problems that make up this TBIL course, as described in Team-Based Inquiry Learning .  Broadly speaking, the problems that you encounter in this course (both inside and outside of the classroom) fall into the following types:    Scaffolded Exploration problems introduce you to a new concept through a sequence of carefully scaffolded activities. These activities include exploratory activities to motivate an entire line of thinking; working a series of examples to have students realize the need for a new definition; and working a carefully scaffolded problem to develop a general algorithm for solving similar problems, for example.     Fluency Builders are designed to help you develop fluency in a new concept. You will work on such problems both in-class with your teammates after learning a new concepts, but also outside of class while you study. All of the problems that you will see on Fluency Assessments are Fluency Builders.     Flexible Extensions are problems that require you to apply a concept in a new setting. These problems can take a variety of forms and include: checking if something satisfies a new definition; extending an idea from its natural setting to something more general; or, a true application to another field or topic. In these activities, the emphasis is on developing a flexible mindset when faced with new problems.     The most common types of problems that you will work on in class are Scaffolded Explorations and Fluency Builders. In contrast, your Problem Sets will largely prioritize Flexible Extensions because these are exactly the types of problems that allow you develop your ability to knowledge-transfer.    How Will You Be Evaluated?  Each Problem Set in this course will contain five (5) problems. For each problem, your task is to solve the problem and prepare a written solution to it. You will then upload your solutions to Gradescope as a single .pdf file, as instruced on Canvas.   Written solutions are more than just answers. A complete solution to a problem:   clearly states what the answer to the problem is;    explains why the claimed answer is indeed the correct answer;    is grounded in sound mathematical reasoning that builds on and\/or refers directly to results, Facts, or Activities that we have explored in class;    is written for an audience of a typical classmate; that is, someone who is generally new to these ideas and has the resources and experiences provided in this Activity Book.     For each problem on your problem set, you will receive a total score of at most 5 points; three (3) of those points are for Problem Solving and two (2) of those points are for Communication .   Problem Solving (3 Points)   The solution uses methods covered in class, is grounded in mathematical reasoning, and solves the problem, when executed accurately.    All key ideas required to solve the problem are introduced in a clear and concise manner.       Communication (2 Points)   The solution is well-written, audience appropriate, and follows principles of good mathematical writing (explained more below).    Mathematical terms and notations are used correctly, and Theorem and Facts are cited appropriately.    Solutions are uploaded to gradescope properly with all relevant pages selected for each question.      In order to grade your work fairly and consistently among our varied sections, the teaching team will meet prior to assessing the Problem Sets in order to decide how to interpret these criteria for each problem on your Problem Set.  After your Problem Set is returned to you, you will be provided an opportunity to reflect on the feedback that you were given and earn two (2) additional point on your Problem Set .    Writing Mathematics Well  Writing Mathematics well is a skill that you can and will develop over time. Like other forms of writing, it will take a lot of practice, and the incorporation of feedback from peers and those with more expertise. While it may feel like it at the beginning, we want to stress that our goal is not to have you write the exact same way that we do. Rather, we want you to be able to express yourself precisely, so that you may share your ideas and perspectives accurately with the greater community .  The writing guide depicted below (by Francis Su of Harvey Mudd College) is a great resource that covers the basic principles of good mathematical writing. A PDF is also available. Use it a checklist when writing your solutions. Almost every deduction we give for communication is a result of work that violates at least one of these principles .  The single greatest piece of advice I can give is: write for a hypothetical student who is anxious about the material. With this audience in mind, take care not ensure that all details are explained well and that you are using ideas and terminology that we have used in class. At the same, work to remove any unnecessary text that does not help with the readability.    This is a short guide to writing mathematics well by Francis Su (Harvey Mudd College). A PDF is also available. Use it a checklist when writing your solutions. Almost every deduction we give for communication is a result of work that violates at least one of these principles .      Getting the Most Out of Your Problem Sets  Out of everything you do in this course, the Problem Sets will take up the most of your effort. They are also where the most significant and lasting learning will happen, provided that you invest the time and resources into yourself for this learning to occur. Take pride in the work you submit this semester it represents the culmination of a lot of time, energy, and creativity on your part, even though you will inevitably experience the ebb and flow of joy and frustration as you get stuck on challenging problems.  Here are some tips to help you get the most of your experience:   Begin your Problem Set early!   They are designed with the intention of them being completed over a period of around 10 days.       Identify key terms in each problem and locate the relevant Activity Book sections.    Identify which learning outcome(s) are aligned with each problem.   These alignments may help you solve the problem.     Every problem you encounter will be aligned with at least one outcome even if it doesn't look like it!       Practice getting unstuck:   Go for a walk, grab a snack, or engage in a hobby.    Talk to a friend, or member of the teaching team in Office Hours.       Avoid external resources (like Youtube, etc.), and rely on internal ones.   These problems are designed to be solved with the concepts and ideas that are introduced in class.    While external resources can be helpful for learning, they may also serve as a crutch and rob you of an opportunity to strengthen an area of weakness.         "

Use algebra and the concepts we've learned about in to explain why the above statement is true.    Provide an alternative explanation using geometry.

Use algebra and the concepts we've learned about in to explain why the above statement is true.    Provide an alternative explanation using geometry.        Interpret each equation as defining a line in the plane. How do the lines vary as varies?      One algebraic approach is to first consider the corresponding augmented matrix: Using row operations, the corresponding RREF is equal to: Then, by , the linear system is inconsistent whenever and is consistent with infinitely many solutions when .    Geometrically, each of the given linear equations describe lines in the -plane. Re-writing the equations as follows: we see that the lines have the same slopes, i.e., they are parallel. It follows that the lines must be identical (in which case the corresponding) solution is infinite, or else they do not intersect at all, in which case there are no solutions. This corresponds to the case where and respectively.      One algebraic approach is to first consider the corresponding augmented matrix: Using row operations, the corresponding equivalent to: If , then this augmented matrix is in RREF and by , the system has infinitely many solutions. Otherwise, when , then the RREF is given by: and the linear system is consistent with a unique solution.    In the -plane, the first equation describes the line passing through with slope equal to . The second line corresponds to the line passing through with slope equal to . Two lines passing through the same point are either equal or intersect in a single point (the point of common intersection). This happens when and respectively, which correspond to the system having infinitely many solutions or a single solution, as desired.         Consider the following linear system, its augmented matrix , and :   All of the following statements are not accurate or otherwise incorrect; identify what is problematic about the statements and correct them.    The matrix is consistent with infinitely many solutions.    The solution set to the linear system is given by .    The variables are free. Setting them equal to respectively and solving for the bound variables, the solution set to the linear system is given by .      A matrix is not an equation, or even a system of equations; a matrix an array of real numbers. Therefore, it does not make sense to say that is consistent\/inconsistent, let alone speak to how many solutions it has.  The given features of , together with indicate that the linear system we were provided is consistent with infinitely many solutions.    The given expression is a single vector with parameters, for which we are not told anything about. The correct way to express the solution set of this system of equations is:     The variables are indeed free variables and the components of the vectors supplied are the correct expressions for the bound variables in terms of the free ones. However, solutions to the linear system have five components (our variables are ) and so our solution set must consist of vectors in . The correct solution set is given above in part (b).        An important step in internalizing concepts and definitions is coming up with your own examples. Consider how might incorporate exercises like the following as part of your regular study routines.   Construct a system of 3 equations in 3 variables having:  0 free variables  1 free variable  2 free variables   3 free variables   In each case, solve the system you have created and write its solution-set in set-notation.   Find three examples of linear systems for which the RREF of their augmented matrices is equal to What do the three matrices you found have in common? Based on this, what do you think might be true of an arbitrary matrix for which its RREF is the matrix given above?     Note that solutions will undoubtedly vary because there are lots of different choices for valid examples! Here is what came to my mind:   The following system has no free variables: Its solution set is .     The following system has 1 free variable (namely, ): Its solution set is .     The following system has 2 free variable (namely, ): Its solution set is .     In the following system, all three of are free: Its solution set is because these equations are valid no matter what.     The RREF of the following matrices are all equal to the given matrix:                   All of these matrices satisfy the following property: each row is a multiple of the first (and only) non-zero row of the matrix that was given to us. In general, any matrix that we can find that is equivalent to our given matrix must be obtained by apply row operations. If we start with a matrix, such as this, with only one non-zero row, then our row operations can only create rows that are multiples of this original row, which means that this phenomena was not a coincidence of the examples we wrote down but, rather, will happen generally.       For each of the following statements, decide if it's true or false. If you think it's true, provide an explanation for why it is true. If you think it's false, find a counterexample that demonstrates that it is false.  If the coefficient matrix of a system of linear equations has a pivot in the rightmost column, then the system is inconsistent.   If a system of equations having four equations and three unknowns is consistent, then the solution is unique.   Suppose that a linear system has five equations and three unknowns and that the coefficient matrix has a pivot in every column. Then the linear system is consistent and has a unique solution.         This statement is false. Consider the following augmented matrix: Then, all columns of the coefficient matrix have a pivot (in particular the right-most), but the system is consistent because the rightmost column of the augmented matrix does not contain a pivot.      This statement is false. Consider the following augmented matrix: This matrix corresponds to a linear system that is consistent and for which are free variables; in particular, the solution set is infinite.      This statement is also false. The assumptions tell us that, if the system were consistent, then there would be no free variable and, therefore, any solution would be unique. However, the assumptions do not rule out a system corresponding to the following augmented matrix: This augmented matrix corresponds to a linear system that is inconsistent, despite the coefficient matrix having a pivot in each of its columns.         Consider the following statement: It is possible for two consistent linear systems to have the same underlying coefficient matrix, but have different numbers of free variables . Determine if this statement is true or false. If you think it is true, provide an example that demonstrates as such; if you think it is false, explain why it is not possible to find two such systems.    This statement is false. Indeed, because we are told that the two systems are consistent, the number of free and bound variables is completely determined by the number of columns that contain pivots in their coefficient matrices. Since we're assuming the two systems have the same coefficient matrices, these values must be the same for both systems, even if their right-hand sides are different.    "

The correct way to express the solution set of this system of equations is:     The variables are indeed free variables and the components of the vectors supplied are the correct expressions for the bound variables in terms of the free ones. However, solutions to the linear system have five components (our variables are ) and so our solution set must consist of vectors in . The correct solution set is given above in part (b).    "

In general, any matrix that we can find that is equivalent to our given matrix must be obtained by apply row operations. If we start with a matrix, such as this, with only one non-zero row, then our row operations can only create rows that are multiples of this original row, which means that this phenomena was not a coincidence of the examples we wrote down but, rather, will happen generally.

Suppose that a linear system has five equations and three unknowns and that the coefficient matrix has a pivot in every column. Then the linear system is consistent and has a unique solution.

Consider the following augmented matrix: This matrix corresponds to a linear system that is consistent and for which are free variables; in particular, the solution set is infinite.

(Problem 1): Application to Traffic Modelling   You are working for a traffic consulting firm that is deciding how best to build a bike line in downtown Banff, Canada.

The numbers on the perimeter denote the total number of vehicles through the given direction in rush-hour and were obtained by using historical data from the City of Banff.

For each of the six intersections depicted in , the total number of vehicles entering the intersection is equal to the total number of vehicles leaving the intersection.

If not, what additional information do you need to ask the City of Banff to collect or otherwise provide for you in order to best inform their design?      Following the procedure at each intersection, we obtain the following six equations: Re-writing as a system of linear equations (moving the constants to the right hand side), we get:     Using Octave to calculate the corresponding RREF, we find that are free variables and, after setting and solving for the bound variables, we get: In particular, the equations are consistent, but there isn't a unique solution, which means we need additional information or constraints from the City of Banff to pin down our data. One way to do this is ask the City of Banff for specific values of based on historical data, or to send an intern out at the corresponding streets to collect this information.      (Problem 2)   Let The set is a subspace. Below are two attempted proofs of the fact that is closed under vector addition. Both of them are invalid; explain why.   Let Then both are elements of .

To be in , we need Well, if then we know that by moving everything over to the left hand side. Since we are assuming that and , it follows that , which is true, which proves that vector addition is closed.      While the calculations in the attempted proof are valid, they only indicate that a specific example of two vectors satisfy the given condition. That is, the argument is not general: a correct proof would have to argue that for any choice of and not just these two choices.    The author begins by starting with the assumption that and then concludes that . This isn't what we want to do for two reasons: Firstly, we already know that , so we haven't learned anything new. More importantly, we do not yet know that the equation is actually true!  To correctly prove this statement, we could start with our assumptions and and explain how to manipulate them in order to show that is true.      (Problem 3)   Consider vectors living inside .   If , explain why it is impossible for these vectors to span all of . That is, prove .    If , explain why it is impossible for these vectors to be linearly independent.      To decide if the set of vectors spans all of , we can use . Consider the matrix . This matrix will have rows and columns. If we assume that , then the maximum number of pivots that can appear in is equal to since each pivot is in a unique row and column. It follows that there must be at least one row in that is missing a pivot and, therefore, these vectors cannot span all of .    To decide if the set of vectors is linearly independent, we can use . Consider the matrix . This matrix will have rows and columns. If we assume that , then the maximum number of pivots that can appear in is equal to since each pivot is in a unique row and column. It follows that there must be at least one column in that is missing a pivot and, therefore, these vectors cannot be linearly independent.      Background Information: The Dot-Product  The purpose of the next few problems are to introduce you to some new definitions and concepts, namely, that of dot product and orthogonality. In doing so, you are being asked to practice working with new definitions and to explore ideas related to them. This short section contains all of the background information you need to complete the problems and you'll get the most learning benefit by working on these exercises without consulting further outside sources.    Given two Euclidean vectors and , the dot product of and is defined to be: In particular, note that the dot product of two Euclidean vectors is a real number.  The dot product satisfies the following properties for any Euclidean vectors and scalar :                   and, the only way we can have is if      The length (or norm) of a vector is denoted by and is given by: Interpreting the vector as an arrow starting at the origin and point in the direction of , this norm agrees with our usual notion of length.  Lastly, the dot product can be used to calculate the angle between two vectors. Consider two vectors and and interpret them as arrows with their tails at the origin. If denotes the angle between these vectors, then it is computed by using the following formula: In particular, it follows that the vectors are perpendicular (or orthogonal) if and only if    Angle between two vectors.    The angle measured from to        Consider working on the following exercise to practice these terms before attempting the next few problems. Answers are provided here for you to check your work; do not include answers to this exercise in your Problem Set solutions.    Let . Calculate , , and determine the angle between and .    Explain why for every choice of Euclidean vector .     Using the formulae in , we compute:  To determine the angle between and , we first calculate the following: This allows us to see that It follows that     If and then by using , we find that On the other hand, if we compute , we get: Since it doesn't matter what order we multiply two real numbers in, these two expressions represent the same quantity.      (Problem 4)    Use the properties of dot products in to prove that the following equation is true for all :     There are several equivalent ways to describe planes in . One way to do so is to provide its equation: where . Another way to describe a plane is to pick a point on the plane and a normal vector  ; then, the plane is described as the set of all vectors for which is perpendicular to .  If you are given a normal vector and a point , explain how to find an algebraic equation for the plane that with normal vector passing through .    Continuing from the above, suppose instead you are given an algebraic equation for a plane: Explain and demonstrate how to find a point on the plane and its normal vector.      Using a combination of our dot product properties, the following chain of equalities explains the result:     Suppose that we are given a normal vector and that . We are given that a plane is described by consider all vectors for which is perpendicular to . It follows, then, that by our dot-product results above.  Expanding this out, we get where . Thus, we've recovered an algebraic equation for the plane.    To find a point , we can basically guess and check. At least one of the coefficients must be non-zero. For sake of argument, if we assume that , then the point satisfies the equation and thus lies on the plane.  For the second part, if is some specific point on the plane and is some other general point, then we know the following are true: Subtracting, we find from which it follows that the vector works as the normal vector.      (Problem 5)   Let be a subspace. If is orthogonal to all vectors in , we will say that is orthogonal to . The set of all vectors that are orthogonal to is called the orthogonal complement of and is denoted by ; in other words, we have   For example, if , then lives in since it's perpendicular to any multiple of , but the vector does not live in . The set is always a subspace, as you will prove below.   Prove that is always a subspace of .    If , explain why if and only if is orthogonal to each of the vectors individually.    Suppose that . Find a set of vectors that spans .     The phrase If and only if in part (b) indicates that there are two statements to prove. First, you must explain why, if , it follows that is perpendicular to each of the vectors in . Second, you must also prove that, if is perpendicular to all the vectors in , then it follows that .     Referring to the definition of subspace, we have to check that satisfies all three conditions:   First, we check that . Since for all , it follows that, indeed, we have .    Next, we check closure under addition. Suppose that we have two vectors and that we know that both live in . By definition, it means that we know that for all .  Using these equations, we then find that for all and so lives in .    Lastly, we check closure under scalar multiplication. Suppose that we have a and that we know that lives in . By definition, it means that we know that for all .  Using this fact, we then find that if , then: for all and so lives in .       Most critically, we must explain two things separately. First, we need to explain why, if , then is perpendicular to the vectors in the set . Secondly, we also have to explain why, if is perpendicular to the vectors in , then we can conclude that .  Let's deal with the first statement first. If we know that , then is perpendicular to all vectors in . Okay, but all the vectors in the set live in and so must therefore be perpendicular to them.  Now let's deal with the second statement. Suppose all we know is that is perpendicular to . If we take some arbitrary vector , we now need to argue that is perpendicular to it as well. For this, since we are given that , it follows that we can find scalars for which But then: It follows that is perpendicular to and since was arbitrary, .    Well, if , then we know by part (b) that this is the same as saying that is perpendicular to our two vectors individually. That is, we know that and Thus, this gives us a system of linear equations to solve!  Using our methods from to solve this system, we find that the solution set is given by which means that      "

Consider the following subsets of Euclidean space defined by Without writing a proof, explain why only one of these subsets is likely to be a subspace.   appears to be a subspace as its equation is a linear combination of variables and constant scalars, and is likely not due to its equation having squared terms.

Consider the following maps of Euclidean vectors and defined by Without writing a proof, explain why only one of these maps is likely to be a linear transformation.    Consider the following map of Euclidean vectors  Prove that  is not a linear transformation.    Consider the following map of Euclidean vectors  Prove that  is a linear transformation.        A linear map between Euclidean spaces must consist of linear polynomials in each component. All three components of are linear so is likely to be linear; however, the third component of contains the nonlinear term , so is unlikely to be linear.    We need to show either that fails to preserve either vector addition or that fails to preserve scalar multiplication.  For example, for a scalar and a vector , we can compute whereas Since , we see that , so fails to preserve scalar multiplication and cannot be a linear transformation.  Alternatively, we could instead take two vectors and compute whereas Since , we see that , so fails to preserve addition and cannot be a linear transformation.    We need to show that preserves both vector addition and that preserves scalar multiplication.  First, let us take two vectors and compute and So we see that , so preserves addition.  Now, take a scalar and a vector , and compute and We see that , so preserves scalar multiplication.  Since preserves both addition and scalar multiplication, we have proven that is a linear transformation.

So we compute Since the first two columns are pivot columns, they form a linearly independent spanning set, so a basis for is   To find a basis for the kernel, note that so a basis for the kernel is     The dimension of the image (the rank) is , the dimension of the kernel (the nullity) is , and the dimension of the domain of is , so we see , which verifies that the sum of the rank and nullity of is the dimension of the domain of .      AT4   Let be the linear transformation given by the standard matrix .    Explain why is or is not injective.    Explain why is or is not surjective.      Compute     Note that the third and fourth columns are non-pivot columns, which means contains infinitely many vectors, so is not injective.    Since there are only two pivots, the image (i.e. the span of the columns) is a 2-dimensional subspace (and thus does not equal ), so is not surjective.      AT5   Let be the set of all pairs of numbers of real numbers together with the following operations:     Show that scalar multiplication distributes over vector addition:     Explain why nonetheless is not a vector space.        We compute both sides:   and   Since these are the same, we have shown that the property holds.    To show is not a vector space, we must show that it fails one of the 8 defining properties of vector spaces. We will show that scalar multiplication does not distribute over scalar addition, i.e., there are values such that     (Solution method 1) First, we compute   Then we compute   Since when , the property fails to hold.    (Solution method 2) When we let , we may simplify both sides as follows.    Since these ordered pairs are different, the property fails to hold.

The set of polynomials is linearly dependent .      Explain how to determine which of these statements is true.      The set of polynomials is linearly independent exactly when the polynomial equation has no nontrivial (i.e. nonzero) solutions. The set is linearly dependent when this equation has a nontrivial (i.e. nonzero) solution.  To solve this equation, we distribute and then collect coefficients to obtain . These polynomials are equal precisely when their coefficients are equal, leading to the system .  To solve this, we compute   The system has (infintely many) nontrivial solutions, so we that the set of polynomials is linearly dependent .
