        <title>(Problem 4)</title>
        <introduction>
            <p>
                In this problem, you will prove that the harmonic series diverges using the definitions of partial sums instead of relying on the integral test. 
                Recall that the harmonic series is the series <m>\sum_{n=1}^\infty\frac{1}{n}</m>.
                Let <m>S_k</m> denote its <m>k</m>-th partial sum:
                <me>S_k=\sum_{n=1}^k\frac{1}{n}=1+\frac{1}{2}+\cdots+\frac{1}{k}.</me>
            </p>
        </introduction>
        <task>
            <statement>
                <p>
                    Explain and demonstrate why the sequence <m>\{S_k\}</m> is monotonically increasing.
                </p>
            </statement>
        </task>
        <task>
            <statement>
                <p>
                    In class, we showed that <m>S_4\geq S_2+\frac{1}{2}</m> and that <m>S_8\geq S_4+\frac{1}{2}</m>.
                    Explain and demonstrate why the inequalities 
                    <me>S_{2^n}\geq S_{2^{n-1}}+\frac{1}{2}\geq 1+\frac{n}{2}</me>
                    hold for all <m>n\geq 2</m>.
                    Conclude that the sequence of partial sums <m>S_{2^n}</m> is unbounded hence must diverge.

        <title>Practice: Do Not Turn In</title>
        <introduction>
            <p>
                Suppose that <m>y=f(x)</m> is some continuous, strictly increasing function defined on an interval <m>[a,b]</m>.
                These assumptions guarantee that <m>f(x)</m> is an invertible function, so we will let <m>x=g(y)</m>, defined on the interval <m>[f(a),f(b)]</m> denote this inverse function.
            </p>
        </introduction>

            <statement>
                <p>
                    Explain why the following equation of integrals is true without doing any calculations:
                    <me>\int_{f\left(a\right)}^{f\left(b\right)}\pi\left[b^2-g\left(y\right)^2\right]dy=\int_a^b2\pi x\left[f\left(x\right)-f\left(a\right)\right]dx</me>
                </p>
            </statement>
        </task>
        <task>
            <statement>
                <p>
                    Use a combination of our integration strategies to provide a second explanation for why this equation is true.
