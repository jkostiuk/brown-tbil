        <p>
            Prior to beginning the Capstone Problem Set, please read the instructions carefully on Canvas. 
            In particular, note the following key elements:
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        You are <em>permitted</em> two (2) collaborators. Here, <q>collaboration</q> refers to thought-partnership in solving problems. 
                        The solutions you submit should clearly indicated your name and the name of your collaborators (as appropriate). 
                        The written work you turn is expected to be your own; if any portion of your work appears to have been generated by someone or something other than yourself, it may be submitted for plagiarism investigation. 
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Unlike a standard problem, <alert>there is no grace period</alert>. 
                        The capstone is due exactly as indicated on Canvas/gradescope. 
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ol>
        </p>
    </paragraphs>
