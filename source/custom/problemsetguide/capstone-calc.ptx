                An <em>oblique cylinder</em> cylinder is a cylinder is a type of cylinder in which the top and bottom bases are parallel but not directly aligned on top of each other; it is a tilted or a slanted cylinder with its sides not necessarily parallel.

        <introduction>
            <p>
                The Fibonnaci sequence is a famous sequence defined recursively by <m>F_0=0, F_1=1,\ F_n=F_{n-1}+F_{n-2}</m> for <m>n\geq 2</m>. 
                So, we have <m>F_2=1,\ F_3=2,\ F_4=3,\ F_5=5</m>, etc.
                By its construction, the sequence <m>\{F_n\}</m> is monotically non-decreasing and is increasing for <m>n\geq 3</m>. 
            </p>
            <task>

                    Consider the related sequence <m>\{a_n\}_{n=0}^\infty</m> given by <m>a_n=\frac{F_{n+1}}{F_n}</m>. 
                    Explain why the sequence <m>a_n</m> is bounded but not monotonic.

                    While the monotonic convergence theorem does not apply to <m>a_n</m>, the sequence <m>a_n</m> is nonetheless convergent (you do not need to explain why). 
                    Given that the limit exists, denote it by <m>\phi</m>; that is, let <m>\phi=\lim_{n\to\infty}a_n</m>. 
                    Explain why <m>\phi=1+\frac{1}{\phi}</m>.

        <introduction>
           <p>
            The purpose of this structured exploration is for you to consider two different ways of approximating a quantity that is difficult to calculuate exactly. 
           </p>
           <p>
            Consider the graph of the function <m>y=f(x)=3+\frac{t^3}{3}</m> where <m>0\leq x\leq 1</m>.

            <statement>
                <p>
                    Explain why the arc-length <m>L</m> of this curve is given by
                    <me>
                        L=\int_0^1\sqrt{1+t^4}dt.
                    </me>
                    This integral is impossible to evaluate using elementary methods.
                    Choose two methods of integration that you think are reasonable for someone to try here, and explain why they nonetheless don't work out.

                <p>
                    Given that we cannot calculate the arc-length directly, an approximation will have to do. 
                    Obtain an approximation of the arc-length by cutting the interval <m>[0,1]</m> into <m>4</m> equal segments and then estimating the arc-length using polygonal line segments (as we did in AI2). 
                    Complete the following table and use it to compute an approximation of the total length. 
                    You are very welcome (and encouraged) to use calculators; round your answers to 5 decimal places when appropriate.
