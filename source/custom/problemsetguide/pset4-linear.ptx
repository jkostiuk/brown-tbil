        <introduction>
            <p>
                In this problem, <m>T\colon V\to W</m> denotes a linear transformation.

                    <p>
                        Show that if <m>\ker(T)=\{\vec{0}\}</m>, then <m>T</m> must be injective. 
                        <em>Note:</em> we saw and used this fact in class, but we did not prove it; the point of this exercise is for you to prove it here.

                    <p>
                        Suppose that <m>\setList{\vec{v}_1,\vec{v}_2,\vec{v}_3}</m> are vectors in <m>V</m> and that the set <m>\setList{T(\vec{v}_1),T(\vec{v}_2),T(\vec{v}_3)}</m> is a linearly independent set. 
                        Does it follows that <m>\setList{\vec{v}_1,\vec{v}_2,\vec{v}_3}</m> is also linearly independent? 
                        If <q>yes</q>, explain why; if <q>no</q>, provide a counterexample to the claim.

                        If <q>yes</q>, explain why; if <q>no</q>, provide a counterexample to the claim.

        <introduction>
            <p>
                Let <m>\IR^+=\{x\in\IR|\ x&gt;0\}</m> denote the set of positive real numbers. 
                Define a new addition on <m>\mathbb{R}^+</m> by the rule <m>x\oplus y=xy</m> (so, in particular, <m>2\oplus 3=6</m>) and define scalar multiplication by <m>\alpha\odot x=x^\alpha</m>. 
                The set <m>\mathbb{R}^+</m> with these operations is a vector space and you can verify this by checking that all 8 of our Vector Space properties are true for <m>\mathbb{R}^+</m>.
                We won't ask you to do all of them here, but we will ask a few:

            <p>
                Let <m>A</m> be an <m>m\times n</m> matrix.
                The <term>transpose</term> of <m>A</m> is the <m>n\times m</m> matrix that is obtained by reflecting the matrix <m>A</m> about the main top-left to bottom-right diagonal and is denoted by <m>A^T</m>.
                For instance, the following is an example of a matrix <m>B</m> and its transpose <m>B^T</m>:
                <me>B=\left[\begin{array}{ccc}1&amp; 2&amp;3\\ 1&amp; 2&amp; 4\end{array}\right],\ \ B^T=\left[\begin{array}{cc}1&amp; 1\\ 2&amp; 2\\3&amp; 4\end{array}\right].</me>
                Now suppose <m>f\colon\mathbb{R}^n\to\mathbb{R}^m</m> is a linear transformation with standard matrix <m>A</m> and let <m>g\colon\mathbb{R}^m\to\mathbb{R}^n</m> denote the linear transformation with standard matrix <m>A^T</m>.

            <statement>
                <p>
                    With <m>A=\left[\begin{array}{cccc}1&amp; 0&amp;2&amp;-3\\3&amp; 2&amp;-1&amp;-1\\4&amp; 2&amp;1&amp;-4\end{array}\right]</m> and notation as defined above, calculate the rank and nullity of the transformations <m>f</m> and <m>g</m>.

            <statement>
                <p>
                    Now suppose that <m>f\colon\mathbb{R}^n\to\mathbb{R}^m</m> is an arbitrary linear transformation, let <m>A</m> denote its standard matrix, and let <m>g</m> be the transformation corresponding to the transpose <m>B=A^T</m>.
                    Explain why the rank of <m>f</m> will always be equal to the rank of <m>g</m>.

                    Notation as in (b), explain why <m>\textrm{null(g)}-\textrm{null(f)}=m-n</m> and conclude that <m>\textrm{null}(f)=\textrm{null}(g)</m> if and only if <m>m=n</m>.
