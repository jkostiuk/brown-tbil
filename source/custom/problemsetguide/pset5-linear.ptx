        <title>(Problem 1)</title>
        <introduction>
            <p>
                In class, we defined the inverse of a matrix in two steps. 
                First, if <m>A</m> is a matrix, we said that <m>A</m> was invertible if the corresponding linear map <m>T\colon\IR^n\to\IR^n</m> was an invertible function. 
                Given this, the inverse of <m>A</m>, denoted <m>A^{-1}</m> was defined to be the standard matrix of the inverse linear map <m>T^{-1}\colon\IR^n\to\IR^n</m>. 
            </p>
            <p>
                An alternative approach would be: an <m>n\times n</m> matrix <m>A</m> is invertible if we can find a matrix <m>B</m> for which <m>AB=BA=I_n</m>; in this case, <m>B</m> is unique and we define <m>A^{-1}</m> to be this matrix. 
                For this problem (and future ones) you may decide to use either characterization you want.

        <title>A Different Take on Matrix Multiplication</title>
        <p>
            In class, we defined the product of two matrices to be the standard matrix of the composition of the two corresponding linear transformations. 
            Here is an alternate formula/definition for the matrix product that builds on the work you've been doing with dot-products. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Suppose that <m>A</m> is an <m>m\times n</m> matrix and that <m>B</m> is an <m>m\times k</m> matrix. 
            Let <m>\vec{r}_1,\dots,\vec{r}_m</m> be the rows of <m>A</m> and let <m>\vec{c}_1,\dots,\vec{c}_k</m> be the columns of <m>B</m>, so that we can write <m>A=\left[\begin{array}{c}\vec{r}_1\\\vdots\\\vec{r}_m\end{array}\right]</m> and <m>B=[\vec{c}_1\ \cdots\ \vec{c}_k]</m>.
            Since the rows of <m>A</m> and the columns of <m>B</m> are all vectors in <m>\IR^n</m>, it makes sense to take the dot-product between them. 
            The matrix product can then be defined by 
            <me>AB=\left[\begin{array}{ccc}\vec{r}_1\bullet\vec{c}_1&amp;\cdots&amp;\ \vec{r}_1\bullet\vec{c}_k\\\vdots &amp;\vdots &amp; \vdots\\\vec{r}_m\bullet\vec{c}_1&amp;\cdots&amp; \vec{r}_m\bullet\vec{c}_k\end{array}\right].</me>
            In other words, the <m>ij</m> entry of the product <m>AB</m> is the dot-product of the <m>i</m>-th row of <m>A</m> and the <m>j</m>-th column of <m>B</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
            As an example, in class, we computed that:
            <me>\left[\begin{array}{cc}1&amp;2\\0&amp;1\\3&amp;5\\-1&amp;-2\end{array}\right]\left[\begin{array}{ccc}2&amp;1&amp;-3\\5&amp;-3&amp;4\end{array}\right]=\left[\begin{array}{ccc}12&amp;-5&amp;5\\5&amp;-3&amp;4\\31&amp;-12&amp;11\\-12&amp;5&amp;-5\end{array}\right].</me>
        </p>
        <p>
            Now, we can check the above as follows: we see that the <m>(3,2)</m> entry of this product is <m>-12</m>.
            This is the same as taking the dot-product of the third row of <m>A</m> and the second column of <m>B</m>:
            <me>\left[\begin{array}{c}3\\5\end{array}\right]\bullet\left[\begin{array}{c}1\\-3\end{array}\right]=-12.</me>
        </p>

                    Explain why the kernel of <m>T</m> is equal to the orthogonal complement of the row space of <m>A</m>.
