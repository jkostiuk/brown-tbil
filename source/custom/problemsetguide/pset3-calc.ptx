        <introduction>
            <p>
                Let <m>R</m> denote the region in the <m>xy</m>-plane that is inside the circle <m>(x-2)^2+y^2=1</m>. 
                If we revolve the region <m>R</m> about the <m>y</m>-axis, we obtain a <em>torus</em>, which is fancy word for doughnut.

                        To help with syntax, here is an example of how one would ask Wolfram Alpha to evaluate <m>\int_0^\frac{\pi}{4} \sin(x)dx</m>:

                        We begin by sketching the region in the <m>xy</m>-plane and the vertical and horizontal line segments as shown in <xref ref="toruscrosssection"/>. 
                        For a given <m>x</m>-value between <m>1</m> and <m>3</m>, the <m>y</m>-coordinates of the top and bottom of the vertical line segment are given by <m>y=\pm\sqrt{1-(x-2)^2}</m>. 
                        Thus, as we revolve the vertical line segment about the <m>y</m>-axis, we obtain a cylindrical shell of area
                        <me>A=2\pi rh=2\pi(x)(2\sqrt{1-(x-2)^2}).</me>
                        It follows that volume is calculated as:
                        <me>V=\int_1^3 2\pi rh=2\pi(x)(2\sqrt{1-(x-2)^2}) dx.</me>

                    <p>
                        This time, as we vary horizontal line segments with <m>y</m> between <m>-1</m> and <m>1</m>, the inner and outer radii are found by solving for <m>x</m> in the equation <m>(x-2)^2+y^2=1</m>. 
                        We find:
                        <me>r_{in}=2-\sqrt{1-y^2}</me>
                        <me>r_{out}=2+\sqrt{1-y^2}.</me>
                        For each fixed <m>y</m>, the area of the corresponding washer is then:
                        <me>A=\pi\left(2+\sqrt{1-y^2}\right)^2-\pi\left(2-\sqrt{1-y^2}\right)^2</me>
                        and so volume is
                        <me>V=\int_{-1}^1\pi\left(2+\sqrt{1-y^2}\right)^2-\pi\left(2-\sqrt{1-y^2}\right)^2 dy</me>

                    <p>
                        When I plugged both of these integrals into Wolfram Alpha, I got <m>4\pi^2</m>.

                        I am going to choose the first one. 
                        Starting with <m>\int_1^3 2\pi rh=2\pi(x)(2\sqrt{1-(x-2)^2}) dx</m>, I substitute <m>u=x-2</m> so <m>du=dx</m> and the integral is:
                        <md>
                            <mrow>\int_1^3 2\pi rh=2\pi(x)(2\sqrt{1-(x-2)^2}) dx \amp =\int_{-1}^14\pi(u+2)\sqrt{1-u^2} du</mrow>
                            <mrow> \amp =4\pi\left[\int_{-1}^1u\sqrt{1-u^2}du +2\int_{-1}^1\sqrt{1-u^2}du \right]</mrow>
                            <mrow> \amp =4\pi(I_1+I_2);</mrow>
                        </md>
                        now I evaluate <m>I_1,I_2</m> separately. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        One approach for <m>I_1</m> is to substitute <m>v=1-u^2</m>. 
                        Another is to observe that since the function <m>u\sqrt{1-u^2}</m> is odd on <m>[-1,1]</m>, it follows that <m>I_1=0</m>. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For <m>I_2</m>, one can use trig sub. Alternatively, this integral represents the area of the top half of the unit disc times <m>2</m>, so <m>I_2=2\frac{\pi}{2}=\pi</m>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Putting it all together, the volume is <m>4\pi(I_1+I_2)=4\pi(0+\pi)=4\pi^2</m>.

        <introduction>
            <p>
                Let <m>S</m> denote the region in 3-space that is above the <m>xy</m>-plane and contained inside the cylinders <m>x^2+z^2=1</m> and <m>y^2+z^2=1</m>; this region is depicted in <xref ref="cylinders"/> below.

                Explain and demonstrate how to calculate the volume of <m>S</m> by considering cross-sections obtained by cutting <m>S</m> with planes perpendicular to one of the three coordinate axes. 
            </p>
        </introduction>
        <hint>
            <p>
                Consider all three kinds of cross-sections; which set of cross-sections seems the simplest to work with. 
            </p>
        </hint>
        <solution>
            <p>
                If we cut with planes that are parallel to the <m>xy</m>-plane, then each cross-section is a square. 
                Using the equations that define the cylinders <m>x^2+z^2=1</m> and/or <m>y^2+z^2=1</m>, the length of the line segments forming an edge of the square are <m>2\sqrt{1-z^2}</m>. 
                It follows the area of each cross section is:
                <me>A=(2\sqrt{1-z^2})^2=4(1-z^2).</me>
            </p>
            <p>
                It follows that

                        The area of <m>R</m> would correspond to the integral <m>\int_1^\infty\frac{dx}{x}</m>.
                        We saw in class that this integral diverges to infinity, so the area is infinite.

                        If we revolve the region about the <m>x</m>-axis and use vertical line segments to generate cross sections, we get discs of radius <m>r=\frac{1}{x}</m>.

            <p>
                In class, we considered the problem of calculating the work involved in pulling a potentially leaky bucket up along a rope. 
                Implicit in the set up of those exercises was the underlying assumption that the rope itself did not weight anything. 
                In this exercise, you'll consider how to modify this model to accommodate a non weight-less rope. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The year is 2011 and you and your accomplice are plotting to steal a bucket of maple syrup weighing a total of 200kg from Canada's strategic Maple Syrup Supply. 
                You'll need to pull this bucket up 10 meters and so you're using a heavy duty rope that weighs 2kg for each meter of rope.

                        One approach is to consider the work lifting the bucket and the rope separately, say <m>W_1</m> and <m>W_2</m>. 
                        If we break up the motion into <m>4</m> evenly spaced lifts of <m>2.5m</m>, then the work needed to lift the bucket is
                        <me>W_1=200(9.8)(2.5)+200(9.8)(2.5)200(9.8)(2.5)+200(9.8)(2.5)=19600N\cdot m.</me>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For the work <m>W_2</m>, we think of cutting the rope into <m>4</m> equal pieces. 
                        Each piece has mass equal to <m>(2.5)(2)=5kg</m>. 
                        If <m>x</m> represents height off the ground, we let <m>x_0=0, x_1=2.5, x_2=5, x_3=7.5</m> with the bottom of piece <m>i</m> is at <m>x_{i-1}</m>, and then the <m>i</m>-th piece moves <m>10-x_i</m> units to get to the top. 
                        Thus, an approximation of the work is equal to:
                        <me>5(9.8)(10-0)+5(9.8)(10-2.5)+5(9.8)(10-5)+5(9.8)(10-7.5)=1225N\cdot m.</me>

                    <p>
                        If we do the same but with <m>n</m> pieces, the work for the bucket is still <m>19600N\cdot m</m> (here, the force isn't varying, so we don't need an integral).
                        For the rope, cut it into pieces of length <m>\Delta x=\frac{10}{n}</m> and let <m>x_i</m> be the position of the bottom of the <m>i</m>-th piece. 
                        Then, the work to move the <m>i</m>-th piece is:
                        <me>W_i=(2)(\Delta x)(9.8)(10-x_i)</me> and the corresponding Riemann sum is then
                        <me>\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}19.6(10-x_i)\Delta x.</me>

                        This Riemann sum corresponds to <m>\int_0^{10}19.6(10-x)dx=980</m>. Adding this to the original 19600, our work is

                NASA wants you to do your best to calculate the length of a piece of wire shaped as the graph the <m>f(x)=xe^{-x^2}</m> over the interval <m>[0,2]</m>.

                        You can't go back to NASA empty handed, so you wrote some code using sage to help you estimate the arc-length below. 
                        By editing the code cell below, vary <m>n</m> (which represents the number of pieces we divide the wire into in making an estimate) find some estimates for NASA.
                        You're reasonably confident that if you can estimate the correct length within three decimal points, this will be enough. 
                        Start with <m>n=10, 15, 20</m>, and then trying larger numbers at your discretion. 
                        Based on your experimenting, how large do you think you should take <m>n</m> to be and what do you think is the approximate length?

                            f(x)=x*exp(-x^2) ###this tells sage what function we're working with
                            a=0 ##this establishes the left endpoint of our interval
                            b=2 ##this establishes the right endpoint
                            n=10 ##this is the number of pieces we cut the wire into. this is what you should vary
                            dx=(b-a)/n ##this is the width of interval
                            k=var("k") ##here, i'm telling sage i want to use "k" as the index variable in the sum
                            ##what follows is the actual sum. you shouldn't alter this line, but if feel free to change the function and starting points above. If you get an error, refresh the activity book to reset this cell
