    <h2>About TBIL</h2>
    

    <h3>What is TBIL?</h3>
<p>Team-Based Inquiry Learning (TBIL) is an implementation of <a href="https://www.teambasedlearning.org/definition/">Team-Based Learning</a> as <a href="http://www.inquirybasedlearning.org/">Inquiry-Based Learning</a> for mathematics. Team-Based Learning is popular in other disciplines such as health sciences, where it is most often implemented as Flipped Learning and/or Case-Based Learning. In mathematics, however, we view it as a way to more easily bring Inquiry-Based Learning into lower division courses such as Precalculus, Calculus, and Linear Algebra.</p>
<p>A typical day in a TBIL class involves students working teams through a series of scaffolded activities to learn the material.  After spending time on an activity, each team simultaneously reports their answer to the class, after which the instructor facilitates a class-wide debrief to inquire into students' thinking.  After bringing the class to a consensus, the instructor provides any needed exposition to prepare students for the next activity. For more details on the TBIL pedagogy, please see our <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/10511970.2019.1666440"><em>PRIMUS</em> paper</a>.</p>
<p>To help instructors get started, we host a
<a href="/library/">library</a> of free and open-source educational resources
aligned for use with TBIL.</p>

<li>Team-Based Learning (TBL) is a cooperative learning strategy blending elements of flipped learning, inquiry-based learning, and problem-based learning. Although used quite frequently in other disciplines, use of this strategy in mathematics has been limited. In this article, we describe how TBL can be implemented in math courses with adherence to essential elements of TBL and introduce modifications specific to mathematics instruction. In particular, we introduce a particular style of TBL, which we term Team-Based Inquiry Learning, that satisfies the defining pillars of inquiry-based learning.</li>

<li>This article examines how student learning is affected by the use of team-based inquiry learning, a novel pedagogy in mathematics that uses team-based learning to implement inquiry-based learning. We conducted quasi-experimental and observational studies in intermediate level mathematics courses, finding that team-based inquiry learning led to increased content mastery and that students took a more flexible approach to solving problems. We also found that in the courses using this pedagogy, women (but not men) had a reduction in communication apprehension over the course of a semester. We conclude that team-based inquiry learning effectively enhances student learning and problem solving, preparing students for future academic success and fostering career readiness.</li>

<li>Team-Based Inquiry Learning (TBIL) is a novel active learning pedagogy designed to facilitate the use of inquiry-based learning in lower division courses. This preliminary report examines supports provided by the TBIL project to instructors, as well as the fidelity of implementation of TBIL by participants of the project. Initial findings suggest that classroom-ready materials and ongoing support, both synchronous and asynchronous, were most helpful to faculty in their TBIL implementations.</li>
